## Key Concepts Explained

### What Are Slash Commands?
Custom prompts you invoke with `/command-name` syntax. They're markdown files in `.claude/commands/` that Claude Code loads and executes.

**See**: FIX_SUMMARY.md ‚Üí Key Concepts ‚Üí Slash Commands

### What Are Hooks?
Executable scripts that run before/after tool executions to enforce safety or log operations. They read/write JSON.

**See**: ARCHITECTURE.md ‚Üí Hooks Format

### What Are Skills?
Documented workflows and patterns that agents reference for guidance. They're NOT executable - just documentation.

**See**: SPECIFICATION.md ‚Üí Skills (README.md section)

### What Are Agents?
Role-specific system contexts that define specialized behavior. Users select them or they're invoked by slash commands.

**See**: ARCHITECTURE.md ‚Üí Agents

### How Do They Relate?
- **Slash Commands** invoke agents with specific prompts
- **Agents** reference skills for workflow guidance
- **Hooks** automatically enforce safety on all tool calls
- **Skills** document patterns for agents to follow

**See**: ARCHITECTURE.md ‚Üí Component Interaction Matrix

## Next Actions

1. ‚úÖ Read QUICK_START.md
2. ‚è≥ Read FIX_SUMMARY.md
3. ‚è≥ Execute IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md Phase 1
4. ‚è≥ Test with test_phase1.sh
5. ‚è≥ Complete Phase 2 and 3

**Remember**: This is a well-conceived template that just needs the implementation to match Claude Code's actual architecture. The fix is straightforward - it's mainly creating the right files in the right places with the right formats.

Good luck! üöÄ
