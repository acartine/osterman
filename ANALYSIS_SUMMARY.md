# Osterman .claude Configuration - Analysis Summary

## Executive Summary

The osterman repository is a template for user-level `.claude` configuration that **appears correct but is fundamentally broken** due to critical misunderstandings of how Claude Code works. The original implementation was based on a conceptual model that doesn't match Claude Code's actual architecture.

**Bottom Line**:
- **Slash commands don't exist** - they're documented but not implemented
- **Hooks are documentation** - they need to be executable scripts
- **Skills and agents are correct** - but their relationship to hooks is conceptual, not executable

## What Was Attempted

The original EXECUTION.md specification aimed to create:

1. **Autonomous agents** with safe guardrails
2. **Slash command shortcuts** for common workflows
3. **Reusable skills** to reduce token usage
4. **Safety hooks** for dangerous operations
5. **Token optimization** through shared components

This was a thoughtful, well-architected plan. The problem is in the **implementation**, not the concept.

## What's Actually Broken

### Critical Issues

| Component | Current State | Problem | Impact |
|-----------|---------------|---------|--------|
| **Slash Commands** | Documented in `hooks/command_router.md` | Wrong location, wrong format | Commands don't work at all |
| **Hooks** | Markdown files with YAML | Need to be executable scripts | Safety guardrails not enforced |
| **Settings** | Minimal permissions only | Missing hook configuration | Hooks can't run |

### The Slash Command Problem

**Current**: `hooks/command_router.md` contains:
```yaml
---
name: command_router
event: pre
description: Parse leading '/' shortcuts...
policy:
  - Recognize messages starting with '/'.
  - Supported commands:
    - '/pe plan DIR=<path>' → ...
```

**Reality**: This is a hook definition (wrong) when it should be individual command files:
```
commands/
├── pe-plan.md      → enables /pe-plan
├── tl-review.md    → enables /tl-review
└── ...
```

**Why This Matters**: Claude Code discovers slash commands by scanning `.claude/commands/` directory. If there are no files there, there are no commands. The `command_router.md` file is just documentation that Claude might see but can't execute.

### The Hook Problem

**Current**: `hooks/pre_safety.md` contains:
```markdown
---
name: pre_safety
event: pre
description: Intercept risky actions...
policy:
  - Block terraform/kubectl apply...
---
```

**Reality**: Hooks must be:
1. Executable scripts (`.sh`, `.py`, etc.)
2. Configured in `settings.json` with matchers
3. Able to read JSON from stdin
4. Able to write JSON to stdout

**Example Correct Hook**:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
INPUT=$(cat)  # Read JSON
# Check if dangerous...
echo '{"continue": false, "stopReason": "Blocked"}'  # Write JSON
```

**Why This Matters**: Without executable hooks configured in settings.json, Claude Code has no way to invoke them. The markdown files are invisible to the hook system.

### The Settings Problem

**Current**: `settings.local.json` only has:
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": ["Bash(test -d /Users/cartine/.claude)"]
  }
}
```

**Needed**: Full hook configuration:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Bash(terraform apply:*)",
      "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "hooks/pre_safety_check.sh"}]
    }]
  },
  "permissions": { ... }
}
```

**Why This Matters**: Hooks are discovered and invoked based on settings.json configuration. Without this, hooks never run.

## What's Actually Working

### These Components Are Fine

1. **Agents** (`agents/*.md`) - Correct format, good content
2. **Skills** (`skills/*.md`) - Correct as documentation
3. **Bin Scripts** (`bin/*`) - Working shell scripts
4. **CLAUDE.md** - Good guidelines
5. **Documentation** - Well-written and comprehensive

The problem is these components reference hooks and commands that don't actually exist in the way they think.

## Conceptual vs Reality Gap

### The Conceptual Model (What Was Intended)

```
User types: /pe plan DIR=./infra
    ↓
command_router hook intercepts message
    ↓
Parses command and invokes pe agent with skill
    ↓
pre_safety hook checks operations
    ↓
Agent executes with guardrails
```

### The Reality (How Claude Code Actually Works)

```
User types: /pe-plan DIR=./infra
    ↓
Claude Code looks for .claude/commands/pe-plan.md
    ↓
Loads file as prompt, replaces $ARGUMENTS
    ↓
Executes with agent context
    ↓
When tool is called, checks settings.json for hooks
    ↓
Runs matching executable hook scripts
    ↓
Hook script returns JSON decision
    ↓
Claude Code allows or blocks tool
```

## The Fix Strategy

### Phase 1: Make It Work (Critical)

1. **Create real slash commands** in `commands/` directory
2. **Create executable hook scripts** with JSON I/O
3. **Create proper settings.json** with hook configuration

This makes the system functional.

### Phase 2: Make It Clear (Documentation)

1. **Add README files** explaining each component
2. **Update main docs** with correct installation
3. **Fix references** to non-existent components

This makes the system understandable.

### Phase 3: Make It Better (Polish)

1. **Add example hooks** for common scenarios
2. **Add integration tests** to verify it works
3. **Clean up obsolete files** that are now misleading

This makes the system maintainable.

## Key Learnings

### Misunderstandings Corrected

| Believed | Actually |
|----------|----------|
| Hooks are markdown with policy | Hooks are executable scripts with JSON I/O |
| command_router.md creates slash commands | Each command needs its own .md file in commands/ |
| Agents can "invoke" skills | Agents read skills as documentation |
| Hooks are referenced in agent frontmatter | Hooks are configured in settings.json |
| Skills are callable functions | Skills are workflow documentation |

### Architecture Clarifications

**Slash Commands**:
- **What**: Custom prompts for common tasks
- **Where**: `.claude/commands/*.md`
- **How**: User types `/command-name`, Claude loads file as prompt
- **Format**: Markdown with optional frontmatter, `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder

**Hooks**:
- **What**: Automated guardrails and telemetry
- **Where**: Executable scripts configured in `settings.json`
- **How**: Claude runs script when tool matches pattern
- **Format**: Script that reads/writes JSON via stdin/stdout

**Skills**:
- **What**: Documented workflows and patterns
- **Where**: `skills/*.md`
- **How**: Agents read for guidance (documentation only)
- **Format**: Markdown with metadata

**Agents**:
- **What**: Role-specific behavior and expertise
- **Where**: `agents/*.md`
- **How**: User selects agent or agent invoked by command
- **Format**: Markdown with role definition

## Documents Created

   - Installation instructions

2. **FIX_SUMMARY.md** (1,500 words)
   - Quick reference for critical fixes
   - Copy-paste ready commands
   - Essential testing steps

3. **ARCHITECTURE.md** (4,000 words)
   - System architecture diagrams
   - Component interaction matrix
   - Data flow examples
   - Security layers

4. **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** (6,000 words)
   - Step-by-step implementation guide
   - Complete code for all components
   - Testing procedures
   - Timeline and checklist

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Review SPECIFICATION.md** - Understand what's broken and why
2. **Review IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** - Follow step-by-step fixes
3. **Execute Phase 1** - Create commands, hooks, and settings
4. **Test thoroughly** - Verify each component works
5. **Execute Phase 2** - Update documentation
6. **Final testing** - Complete integration test

### Estimated Effort

- **Phase 1** (Critical): 6-8 hours
- **Phase 2** (Documentation): 4-5 hours
- **Phase 3** (Polish): 5-6 hours
- **Total**: 15-19 hours over 3-5 days

### Success Criteria

The configuration is fixed when:

1. ✅ Typing `/pe-plan DIR=./infra` in Claude Code invokes the command
2. ✅ Running `terraform apply` is blocked by pre_safety_check.sh
3. ✅ Running `terraform plan` is allowed and logged
4. ✅ All 8 slash commands appear in `/help` output
5. ✅ Hooks appear in telemetry.jsonl
6. ✅ Settings.json configures all hooks correctly
7. ✅ Installation to ~/.claude works smoothly
8. ✅ Documentation accurately reflects implementation
9. ✅ All tests pass
10. ✅ Ready for public distribution

## Files to Reference

- **SPECIFICATION.md** - Comprehensive analysis and specifications
- **FIX_SUMMARY.md** - Quick fix guide
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - System architecture and design
- **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** - Step-by-step implementation guide
- **EXECUTION.md** - Original specification (for context)

## Questions to Answer

### For Understanding
1. ✅ What's the difference between a slash command and a hook?
   - Command: User-invoked prompt; Hook: Auto-invoked script

2. ✅ Why are hooks executable scripts and not markdown?
   - Must read JSON input, write JSON output for runtime decisions

3. ✅ Where do slash commands go?
   - `.claude/commands/` directory (NOT hooks/)

4. ✅ How do agents use skills?
   - By reading skill docs for workflow guidance (not execution)

### For Implementation
1. ⏳ Should we keep the old hooks/*.md files?
   - Move to hooks/docs/ or remove to avoid confusion

2. ⏳ Do we need both settings.json and settings.local.json?
   - Yes: settings.json for shared config, local for machine-specific

3. ⏳ How do we test hooks without Claude Code?
   - Direct script execution: `echo '{...json...}' | hook.sh`

4. ⏳ Can hooks modify tool inputs?
   - Yes (v2.0.10+): Return modified tool_input in JSON

## Conclusion

The osterman template is **well-conceived but incorrectly implemented**. The original vision of autonomous agents with safety guardrails is sound. The implementation just needs to match Claude Code's actual architecture.

**The Good News**:
- Most components are fine (agents, skills, bin scripts)
- The architecture makes sense
- The fixes are straightforward (not a redesign)
- Comprehensive documentation now exists

**The Work Ahead**:
- Create 8 slash command files (~2 hours)
- Create 2 executable hook scripts (~2 hours)
- Create proper settings.json (~1 hour)
- Update documentation (~4 hours)
- Test everything (~3 hours)
- **Total**: ~12-15 hours

**The Outcome**:
A working, well-documented .claude configuration template that demonstrates proper Claude Code usage and can be installed globally or per-project.
