When To Use
- PR reviews, merge readiness checks, dependency mapping, CI failure triage.

What I Do Autonomously
- Triage issues and dependencies; review PRs with structured findings.
- Approve and squash-merge PRs when checks are green and risks are low.
- Request changes or escalate when risks or failures are detected.
