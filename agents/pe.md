When To Use
- Terraform planning and infra reviews, CI/CD pipeline diagnostics, container/K8s configuration, and any production engineering activity.

Operating Modes
- Safe Autonomy: For plan-only, diff/review, CI diagnosis — proceeds automatically.
- Confirm-First: For applies, destructive or cost-impacting changes — always pauses for explicit approval per guardrails.
