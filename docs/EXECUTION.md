## Original Objectives

The original specification outlined these primary goals:

1. **Autonomous Agents with Guardrails**
   - Make subagents autonomous by default with safe guardrails
   - Require explicit approval for high-risk operations
   - Implement confirm-first flow for production changes

2. **Production Engineering Hybrid Agent**
   - Consolidate infrastructure + pair-programmer into single `pe` agent
   - Safe autonomy for plan-only/analysis
   - Mandatory approval for apply/destructive operations

3. **Token Optimization**
   - Lean prompts via skill composition
   - Shared reusable capabilities in `skills/`
   - Context scoping and progressive disclosure
   - Centralized policies in `CLAUDE.md`

---

## Original Design Plan

### Phase 1: Baseline Conventions & Autonomy Policy

**Goal:** Establish autonomy policy and agent conventions

**Implementation:**
- Added `CLAUDE.md` sections for:
  - Autonomy Policy (default autonomous with explicit exceptions)
  - Safety Guardrails (high-risk operations requiring approval)
  - Token Usage Policy (context scoping, summarization)
- Defined agent front matter structure with autonomy, skills, hooks, scope

**Status:** ✓ Completed

### Phase 2: Skills Library

**Goal:** Create reusable, composable skill modules

**Planned Skills:**
- GitHub Management: `gh_issue_triage`, `gh_dependency_detect`, `gh_pr_review`, `gh_pr_merge`
- PR Quality & CI: `ci_fail_investigate`, `test_health_report`
- Infra Guardrails: `tf_plan_only`, `infra_change_review`
- Implementation: `impl_branch_workflow`, `arch_integration_plan`
- Token Efficiency: `context_scoper`, `diff_summarizer`

**Status:** ✓ Completed - Skills created in `skills/` directory

### Phase 3: Guardrail Hooks

**Goal:** Add cross-cutting safety, context, and telemetry hooks

**Planned Hooks:**
- `pre_safety` - Intercept destructive commands, require approval
- `context_trim` - Auto-summarize large files
- `post_telemetry` - Emit action summary and token estimates
- `gh_event_heuristics` - Periodic PR/issue checks

**Implementation:**
- Created `hooks/pre_safety_check.sh` as executable bash script
- Created `hooks/post_telemetry.sh` for tool usage logging
- Configured in `settings.json` with PreToolUse/PostToolUse triggers
- Logs to `~/.claude/telemetry.log`

**Status:** ✓ Completed (implemented as executable hooks rather than MD specs)

### Phase 4: Refactor Agents to Use Skills

**Goal:** Update agents to be thin prompts referencing skills and hooks

**Agent Composition:**
- `tl` → skills: GitHub management, CI investigation
- `pe` → skills: Terraform plan-only, infra review, context scoping
- `swe` → skills: Branch workflow, diff summarization, context scoping
- `test-engineer` → skills: Test health reporting, diff summarization
- `code-debugger` → skills: Context scoping
- `software-architect` → skills: Architecture planning, context scoping

**Status:** ✓ Completed - Agents reference skills and follow lean prompt pattern

### Phase 5: Add Production Engineering (pe)

**Goal:** Create hybrid agent with plan-only autonomy and confirm-first for applies

**Features:**
- Safe autonomy for `terraform plan`, analysis, and reviews
- Confirm-first for `terraform apply`, `kubectl apply/delete`, destructive ops
- Enforced via `pre_safety_check.sh` hook
- Skills: `tf_plan_only`, `infra_change_review`, `context_scoper`

**Status:** ✓ Completed - `/pe` command with plan/apply workflows

### Phase 6: Rollout & Validation

**Goal:** Validate agents and hooks, adjust scopes

**Validation:**
- Created comprehensive test suite (`test/validate-config.sh`)
- Makefile targets for installation and testing
- Documentation for installation, troubleshooting, and usage
- Verified hook triggers and safety blocks

**Status:** ✓ Completed - Full validation and documentation

## Differences from Original Specification

### Commands vs. Agents

**Original:** Agents invoked directly
**As-Built:** Commands (slash commands) invoke agents

Commands in `commands/*.md` serve as the user interface, while agents in `agents/*.md` provide the implementation. This provides clearer separation and better UX.

### Executable Hooks vs. Markdown Specs

**Original:** Hooks as MD specification files
**As-Built:** Hooks as executable bash scripts (`.sh`)

Implemented hooks as executable scripts referenced in `settings.json` rather than markdown specifications. This provides:
- Direct integration with Claude Code hook system
- Immediate execution without interpretation layer
- Standard bash scripting capabilities
- JSON response format for hook decisions

### Settings Structure

**Original:** Hook configuration unspecified
**As-Built:** Complete `settings.json` with:
- PreToolUse/PostToolUse hook configuration
- Permission controls (allow/ask lists)
- Environment variables (CLAUDE_TELEMETRY)
- 47 bash commands in allow list

### Installation System

**Original:** Symlink-based global installation
**As-Built:** Makefile-based installation with backup

Added comprehensive installation system:
- `make install` - Global installation to `~/.claude`
- `make install-local` - Project-local installation
- Automatic backup of existing configuration
- Hook script permission management
- Validation testing

### Documentation Suite

**Original:** Basic README
**As-Built:** Complete documentation set

Created comprehensive documentation:
- `README.md` - Feature overview and quick start
- `INSTALLATION.md` - Detailed installation guide
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Common issues and solutions
- `EXECUTION.md` (this file) - As-built specification

---

## Token Optimization Implementation

### Achieved Optimizations

1. **Lean Agent Prompts**
   - Agents: 1-2 paragraphs + skill/hook references
   - Commands: Focused instructions with examples
   - Removed duplicated checklists

2. **Skill Composition**
   - Reusable skills in `skills/` directory
   - Agents reference skills rather than inline procedures
   - Skills shared across multiple agents

3. **Context Scoping**
   - Commands specify allowed-tools in frontmatter
   - `context_scoper` skill for targeted file access
   - `diff_summarizer` skill for large diffs

4. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Start with summaries, expand on demand
   - Hook telemetry provides usage metrics
   - Centralized policies in `CLAUDE.md`

### Token Usage Tactics

As documented in `CLAUDE.md`:
- Prefer scoped context using `rg` over full tree reads
- Summarize large diffs/files instead of full content
- Centralize procedures in skills/hooks, reference from agents
- Use progressive disclosure patterns
- Reuse existing build/test targets

---

## Safety & Guardrails Implementation

### Pre-Safety Check Hook

Blocks high-risk operations:
- `terraform apply`, `terraform destroy`
- `kubectl apply`, `kubectl delete`
- `psql` with DROP/DELETE/TRUNCATE
- `aws` with delete/terminate operations
- `az` with delete operations
- `docker system prune`

Returns JSON: `{"decision": "block"}` or `{"decision": "approve"}`

### Permission Controls

**Auto-approved tools:**
- Read, Grep, Glob
- 47 bash commands (git, make, npm, docker, terraform, etc.)

**Require user confirmation:**
- Write, Edit

**Blocked unless approved:**
- Destructive infrastructure operations (via pre-safety hook)

### Autonomy Policy

Documented in `CLAUDE.md`:
- **Default:** Agents operate autonomously for routine work
- **Require approval for:**
  - terraform apply, kubectl apply/delete (non-kind)
  - Production DB migrations and schema changes
  - Secret/key rotations, IAM policy changes
  - DNS, TLS/SSL, CDN, WAF changes
  - Destructive operations (delete/purge/backfill)
  - Cost-impacting infrastructure changes
