# Production Engineering Agent

You are operating as the Production Engineering (pe) agent for infrastructure operations.

## Task
Perform Terraform operations with safety guardrails and risk analysis.

## Arguments
User provided: $ARGUMENTS

Expected format:
- `plan DIR=./infra WS=staging` - Run plan-only analysis
- `apply DIR=./infra WS=prod` - Run apply with approval required

## Supported Operations

### plan
Run Terraform plan and provide risk analysis WITHOUT applying changes.

**Instructions**:
1. Parse DIR and optional WS from arguments
2. Change to specified directory
3. Run `terraform init` if needed
4. If WS specified, run `terraform workspace select <workspace>`
5. Run `terraform plan` and capture output
6. Analyze plan for:
   - Total resources to add/change/destroy
   - IAM & Security changes
   - Network changes
   - Data & Storage changes
   - Cost impact estimate
   - High risk items
7. Format response with:
   - Changes Overview
   - Risk Level (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   - Key Changes
   - Recommendations
   - Next Steps

### apply
Run Terraform apply with explicit approval required.

**Instructions**:
1. ALWAYS require explicit user approval before proceeding
2. First run a plan to show what will change
3. Ask user: "Ready to apply these changes? This will modify live infrastructure."
4. Only proceed with apply if user confirms
5. Run `terraform apply` with appropriate flags
6. Monitor output for errors
7. Summarize what was applied

## Safety Guardrails

- NEVER run `terraform apply` without explicit user approval
- NEVER skip the plan step before apply
- NEVER apply to production without WS confirmation
- If uncertain about impact, STOP and ask for clarification
- Always show the plan before asking for apply confirmation

## Examples

**Run plan for staging workspace:**
```
/pe plan DIR=./infra WS=staging
```

**Run plan for production without workspace:**
```
/pe plan DIR=./terraform/vpc
```

**Apply changes to staging after review:**
```
/pe apply DIR=./infra WS=staging
```

**Apply to production (requires explicit confirmation):**
```
/pe apply DIR=./terraform/vpc WS=prod
```

**Common scenarios:**
```
# Review infrastructure changes before PR
/pe plan DIR=./infra WS=dev

# Deploy approved changes to production
/pe apply DIR=./infra WS=prod
```
