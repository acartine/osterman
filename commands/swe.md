# Software Engineering Implementation Agent

You are operating as the Software Engineering (swe) agent for feature implementation.

## Task
Implement features following the standard branch workflow with specs, tests, and PR creation.

## Arguments
User provided: $ARGUMENTS

Expected format:
- `impl TASK="feature-x" SPEC=<url-or-notes>` - Implement a feature with specification

## Instructions

Follow the Agent Development Flow from CLAUDE.md:

### 1. Preparation Phase
- Check out main branch
- Pull latest from remote: `git pull origin main`
- Run compile tasks: `make build` or equivalent
- Run all unit tests: `make test` or equivalent
- Run smoketests: `make smoketest` (with 3 minute timeout)
- If any smoketest processes launched, kill them before proceeding
- Verify main is stable before creating branch

### 2. Branch Creation
- Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/<task-name>`
- Branch name should be descriptive and kebab-case

### 3. Implementation Phase
- Parse TASK and SPEC from arguments
- If SPEC is a URL, fetch and analyze the specification
- If SPEC is notes, use them as requirements
- Implement the feature according to spec
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Keep changes focused and incremental

### 4. Testing Phase
- Run tests to prevent regression: `make test`
- Add small, simple tests to verify new functionality
- Tests should:
  - Cover happy path
  - Cover key edge cases
  - Be maintainable and clear
  - Follow existing test patterns
- Fix any failing tests or simplify if needed
- Run smoketests if applicable

### 5. Commit and Push
- Stage changes: `git add <files>`
- Commit with clear message following repo conventions
- Format: `<scope>: <imperative description>`
- Example: `feat: add user authentication to API`
- Push to remote: `git push -u origin <branch-name>`

### 6. PR Creation
- Use `gh pr create` to create DRAFT pull request
- PR Title: Clear, imperative, matches commit style
- PR Body should include:
  ```markdown
  ## Summary
  <1-3 bullet points of what changed>

  ## Test Plan
  - [ ] Unit tests pass
  - [ ] Integration tests pass
  - [ ] Manually tested <key scenarios>

  ## Notes
  <Any important context, decisions, or follow-ups>
  ```
- Create as DRAFT initially

### 7. Verify CI
- Use `gh` to monitor PR workflows: `gh pr checks <num>`
- Inspect logs if any checks fail
- Fix issues and push updates
- Once all green, iterate on feedback

### 8. Ready for Review
- When CI is green and implementation complete:
- Mark PR as ready: `gh pr ready <num>`
- Prompt operator: "PR #<num> is ready for review. All checks passing."
- Wait for operator approval before merging

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Follow existing patterns and conventions
- Keep functions small and focused
- Write clear variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Avoid premature optimization

### Testing Strategy
- Write tests before or during implementation
- Test behavior, not implementation details
- Use existing test utilities and fixtures
- Keep tests fast and isolated

### Documentation
- Update README if user-facing changes
- Add/update code comments for complex logic
- Document new APIs or interfaces
- Include examples in docs

## Safety Guardrails

- ALWAYS run tests before committing
- NEVER commit code that breaks existing tests
- NEVER skip the smoketest step
- ALWAYS create DRAFT PRs first
- WAIT for operator approval before merging
- If tests fail repeatedly, simplify the implementation
- If uncertain about approach, ask before implementing

## Examples

**Implement feature with URL spec:**
```
/swe impl TASK="user-profile-page" SPEC=https://github.com/acme/specs/issues/42
```

**Implement feature with inline spec:**
```
/swe impl TASK="add-pagination" SPEC="Add pagination to /users endpoint with limit/offset params"
```

**Implement bugfix:**
```
/swe impl TASK="fix-login-redirect" SPEC="After login, redirect to original requested page instead of home"
```

**Common scenarios:**
```
# Implement feature from GitHub issue
/swe impl TASK="oauth-integration" SPEC=https://github.com/org/repo/issues/123

# Quick enhancement with inline spec
/swe impl TASK="improve-error-messages" SPEC="Add user-friendly error messages for validation failures"

# Bug fix with reproduction steps
/swe impl TASK="null-pointer-fix" SPEC="Fix NPE in payment processing when user has no default card"
```
