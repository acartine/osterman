# Osterman Claude Configuration

Production-ready Claude Code configuration for autonomous software development workflows.

## What is this?

The `osterman` .claude configuration provides specialized slash commands, safety hooks, and autonomous agent workflows for professional software development. It implements a secure, efficient approach to infrastructure management, code implementation, PR review, and debugging using Claude Code CLI.

## Why is it called `osterman`?
Before he was Dr. Manhattan, he was Jon Osterman.  We hope someday to be Dr. Manhattan.

## Features

### Slash Commands

Seven specialized commands for common development workflows:

- **`/test-health`** - Generate test health reports with flaky and slow test analysis
- **`/pe`** - Production Engineering workflows with safety guardrails for infrastructure changes
- **`/tl`** - Team Lead workflows for PR review, issue triage, and merge management
- **`/swe`** - Software Engineering implementation with branch workflow and DRAFT PRs (Sonnet-powered)
- **`/jswe`** - Junior Software Engineering for simple tasks (Haiku-powered, faster and cheaper)
- **`/dbg`** - Code debugging with scoped analysis and fix proposals
- **`/arch`** - Architecture planning and integration design

### Safety Hooks

Two executable hooks that enforce guardrails:

- **`pre_safety_check.sh`** - Blocks dangerous infrastructure operations (terraform apply, kubectl delete, etc.)
- **`post_telemetry.sh`** - Logs tool usage for audit and analysis

### Guardrails

- Blocks destructive operations without explicit approval
- Requires confirmation for production changes
- Prevents accidental infrastructure modifications
- Comprehensive permission controls for 47+ bash commands

### Token Optimization

- Scoped context using ripgrep
- Progressive disclosure patterns
- Skill-based composition
- Summarized diffs and large files

### Recommended Tooling

This configuration recommends using the **shemcp** MCP server for enhanced bash command execution:

- **[shemcp](https://github.com/acartine/shemcp)** - Shell command execution MCP server with improved reliability and performance
- Automatically preferred by agents when available for commands like: `aws`, `az`, `grep`, `sed`, `npm`, `make`, `terraform`, and more
- See [shemcp installation instructions](https://github.com/acartine/shemcp#installation) to set up

**Don't want to use shemcp?** Simply remove the shemcp-related tooling section from the top of `CLAUDE.md` in your configuration. The agents will fall back to standard bash execution.

## Hooks Overview

### Pre-Safety Check (`pre_safety_check.sh`)

Intercepts Bash tool calls before execution and blocks high-risk operations:

- Terraform apply/destroy commands
- Kubernetes apply/delete operations
- Production database commands
- AWS/Azure destructive operations
- Docker system prune

Returns JSON with `{"decision": "block"}` or `{"decision": "approve"}`.

### Post-Telemetry (`post_telemetry.sh`)

Logs all tool usage to `~/.claude/telemetry.log` for:

- Audit trails
- Usage analysis
- Performance monitoring
- Compliance tracking

Logs include timestamp, tool name, description, and exit status.

## Installation

See [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) for detailed installation instructions, including:

- Prerequisites
- Global vs. project-local installation
- Manual installation steps
- Verification and testing
- Updating and uninstallation

## Testing

### Run Validation Tests

```bash
make test
```

The test suite validates:

- Directory structure
- settings.json syntax and hook references
- Hook script executability and format
- Command frontmatter and examples
- CLAUDE.md content

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Test a hook script directly
./.claude/hooks/pre_safety_check.sh "terraform apply"
./.claude/hooks/post_telemetry.sh "Bash" "test command" "0"

# Validate settings.json syntax
jq empty settings.json

# Test a command
claude /test-health
```

## Troubleshooting

See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for solutions to common issues:

- Commands not recognized
- Hooks not triggering
- Permission errors
- Model configuration issues
- jq installation problems

### Models Used

- **Sonnet 4.5**: `sonnet` (default for most commands: /swe, /dbg, /arch, /tl, /doc, /orient)
- **Haiku 4.5**: `haiku` (for lightweight operations: /jswe)

Commands specify their model in frontmatter; defaults to Sonnet if not specified. Use `/jswe` instead of `/swe` for simple tasks to save cost and time.

## Customization

### Adding New Commands

Create a new `.md` file in `commands/`:

```markdown
---
description: Brief description of what this command does
model: sonnet
allowed-tools: Bash(make:*), Read, Grep
---

# Command Name

Instructions for the agent...

## Examples

\`\`\`
/your-command arg1 arg2
\`\`\`
```

### Modifying Safety Rules

Edit `.claude/hooks/pre_safety_check.sh` to add or remove blocked patterns:

```bash
# Add new dangerous pattern
if echo "$COMMAND" | grep -qE 'rm -rf /'; then
  block "Blocked: dangerous rm command"
fi
```

### Extending Permissions

Edit `settings.json` to add new allowed commands:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(your-command:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```
